# üêè 03 ‚Äì Functions

Welcome to **Functions**! ‚≠ê
In Haskell, functions are the **heart** of the language. You've already seen expressions and types, now you'll learn how to wrap them into reusable building blocks.

> üí° **Learning Tip:** This course includes a built-in notes system! Keep track of concepts you struggle with in one convenient place instead of re-reading entire lessons. Check out the `notes/` folder to reinforce your learning and review key insights anytime.

## üìù Function Definitions

A **function** is just giving a name to an expression (with inputs).
General form:

```haskell
functionName arg1 arg2 ... = expression
```

Example:

```haskell
square x = x * x
```

-   `square` is the function's name
-   `x` is the parameter (input)
-   `x * x` is the body (output expression)

Try it in GHCi (define it first, then use it):

```haskell
ghci> square x = x * x
ghci> square 5
25
```

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Type Signatures

Every function has a **type**.
We write it above the definition using `::` ("has type").

```haskell
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x
```

üìù **Simplified**: The rightmost type is always the output. Everything before it are inputs.

-   `Input Type -> Output Type`

üí° Just like before, Haskell can **infer** this type for you, but writing it makes your code more readable and less error-prone.

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è Multiple Arguments & Currying

In Haskell, a function always takes just **one** argument.
So how do we handle multiple arguments? ‚Üí We chain functions together.

### Step 1: The Normal Definition

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

Looks like `add` takes two numbers and returns one.

But actually‚Ä¶

### Step 2: What It Really Means

```haskell
add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
```

Read as:

-   "`add` takes an `Int`"
-   "and returns a function that takes another `Int`"
-   "and that second function returns an `Int`"

So `Int -> Int -> Int` is really shorthand for `Int -> (Int -> Int)`.

### Step 3: Applying Arguments

When you call:

```haskell
add 3 4
```

This is actually evaluated as:

```haskell
(add 3) 4
```

-   `add 3` ‚Üí produces a new function of type `Int -> Int` ("add three to whatever you give me").
-   Then `(... 4)` applies that new function to `4`.

### Step 4: Partial Application

Since functions take arguments one at a time, you don't have to give them all at once:

```haskell
add 3       -- produces a function Int -> Int
(add 3) 4   -- applies it to 4, result = 7
```

You can save the partially applied function:

```haskell
inc :: Int -> Int
inc = add 1

inc 5   -- 6
inc 100 -- 101
```

Another one:

```haskell
addTen = add 10
addTen 25
-- 35
```

‚úÖ **Key takeaway:**
Currying = turning a multi-argument function into a series of single-argument functions.
That's why every function in Haskell is technically a one-argument function; multi-argument syntax is just a convenient shorthand that Haskell provides to make code easier to read and write.

> üí≠ **Don't worry if this feels confusing at first!** Currying is one of the trickier concepts in functional programming. It takes time and practice to really "click." The exercises will give you hands-on experience with these ideas, making them much clearer.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Function Application Precedence

Function calls in Haskell **don't** use parentheses or commas.
Instead, you **separate arguments with spaces** and place them directly after the function name:

```haskell
-- Haskell
f x y
```

Here's what's happening step by step:

-   `f` is a function that takes two arguments
-   `x` and `y` are the arguments (values or variables)
-   Due to currying, `f x y` is evaluated as `(f x) y`
-   First: `f x` produces a new function (remember: `f` takes one argument at a time)
-   Then: that new function is applied to `y` to get the final result

**Example:**

```haskell
add 3 5
-- Step 1: (add 3) creates a function "add 3 to whatever comes next"
-- Step 2: (add 3) 5 applies that function to 5, giving us 8
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important rules:

1. **Function application has highest precedence** (binds tighter than operators).

    ```haskell
    square 3 + 4
    -- means (square 3) + 4, not square (3 + 4)
    ```

2. **No commas between arguments**.

    ```haskell
    max 5 10
    -- ‚úÖ correct

    max(5, 10)
    -- ‚ùå error
    ```

3. **Use parentheses to group expressions**.

    ```haskell
    square (3 + 4)
    -- 49
    ```

### More Precedence Examples

```haskell
-- These are all different:
f g h x    -- means ((f g) h) x
f (g h x)  -- means f (g (h x))
f g (h x)  -- means (f g) (h x)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Guards: Better Conditionals

**Guards** are Haskell's way of choosing between different expressions based on conditions. Think of them as a cleaner alternative to multiple `if-then-else` statements.

### How Guards Work

Instead of writing messy nested conditionals:

```haskell
-- Ugly nested if-then-else
absoluteValue n = if n >= 0 then n else (-n)
```

You can use guards with the `|` symbol (pipe):

```haskell
-- Clean guards syntax
absoluteValue :: Int -> Int
absoluteValue n
  | n >= 0    = n      -- if n >= 0, return n
  | otherwise = -n     -- otherwise, return -n
```

### Guard Syntax Rules

1. **Each guard starts with `|`** followed by a boolean condition
2. **Each guard ends with `=`** followed by the result expression
3. **Guards are checked top to bottom** until one matches
4. **`otherwise`** is just another name for `True` (catches any remaining cases)

### More Complex Example

```haskell
gradeToLetter :: Int -> String
gradeToLetter score
  | score >= 90 = "A"    -- if score is 90 or higher
  | score >= 80 = "B"    -- else if score is 80-89
  | score >= 70 = "C"    -- else if score is 70-79
  | score >= 60 = "D"    -- else if score is 60-69
  | otherwise   = "F"    -- else (anything below 60)
```

## üè† Local Definitions: Where & Let

Sometimes your function needs to calculate intermediate values that you'll use multiple times or that make your code clearer. These are called **helper values** - they're not the final result, but they help you build toward it.

**Helper values** let you:

-   Break complex calculations into smaller, named pieces
-   Avoid repeating the same computation
-   Make your code more readable

Haskell gives you two ways to define these local helper values: `where` and `let`.

### Using `where`

With `where`, you write your main expression first, then define the helper values afterward:

```haskell
hypotenuse :: Float -> Float -> Float
hypotenuse a b = sqrt total      -- main expression uses 'total'
  where
    total = a*a + b*b           -- helper value defined here

bmiTell :: Float -> Float -> String
bmiTell weight height =
    if bmi < 18.5               -- main expression uses 'bmi'
    then "Underweight"
    else if bmi < 25.0
    then "Normal"
    else "Overweight"
  where
    bmi = weight / height^2     -- helper value calculated once
```

### Using `let`

With `let`, you define the helper values first, then use them in the main expression after `in`:

```haskell
hypotenuse :: Float -> Float -> Float
hypotenuse a b =
    let total = a*a + b*b       -- helper values defined first
    in sqrt total               -- main expression after 'in'

cylinderArea :: Float -> Float -> Float
cylinderArea r h =
    let sideArea = 2 * pi * r * h    -- multiple helper values
        topArea = pi * r^2
    in sideArea + 2 * topArea        -- main expression uses both
```

### When to Use Which?

-   **`where`**: When you want to focus on the main logic first, then explain the details
-   **`let`**: When you want to set up your calculations first, then show the final step

Both do the same thing - they just read differently!

## üîó Function Composition

**Function composition** is a way to create new functions by chaining existing functions together. Think of it like connecting pipes; the output of one function becomes the input of the next.

### Why Compose Functions?

Instead of writing deeply nested function calls that are hard to read:

```haskell
result = square (addOne (multiply 2 x))  -- hard to follow the flow
```

You can create a clear pipeline of transformations:

```haskell
transform = square . addOne . multiply 2
result = transform x                     -- much cleaner!
```

### How the `(.)` Operator Works

The composition operator `(.)` has this type:

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```

This means: "give me a function from `b` to `c`, and a function from `a` to `b`, and I'll give you a function from `a` to `c`."

**Key insight**: The functions are applied **right to left** (like mathematical function composition).

### Step-by-Step Example

```haskell
addOne x = x + 1
square x = x * x

-- Create a composed function
addThenSquare = square . addOne
-- This is equivalent to: addThenSquare x = square (addOne x)

-- Usage
addThenSquare 3
-- Step 1: addOne 3 = 4
-- Step 2: square 4 = 16
-- Result: 16
```

### Chaining Multiple Functions

```haskell
double x = x * 2
addOne x = x + 1
square x = x * x

-- Chain them together (read right to left)
transform = square . addOne . double
-- This means: double first, then addOne, then square

-- Usage
transform 3
-- Step 1: double 3 = 6
-- Step 2: addOne 6 = 7
-- Step 3: square 7 = 49
-- Result: 49
```

**Benefits:**

-   **Readability**: Clear pipeline of transformations
-   **Reusability**: Compose functions to create new, specialized functions
-   **No intermediate variables**: No need to store temporary results

## üîÑ Higher-Order Functions Preview

Functions can **take other functions** as arguments:

```haskell
applyTwice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
applyTwice f x = f (f x)

-- Usage
applyTwice square 3   -- 81 (square(square(3)))
applyTwice (+1) 5     -- 7  ((+1)((+1)(5)))
```

> üí° Don't worry if this seems complex, we'll cover higher-order functions in detail later!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Function Application Precedence

```haskell
sqrt a * a + b * b
-- actually means (sqrt a) * a + b * b
-- ‚ùå wrong for hypotenuse!

sqrt (a*a + b*b)
-- ‚úÖ correct
```

### Arrow Type Confusion

```haskell
-- Don't think -> means "returns"
Int -> Int -> Int
-- More precise: "takes an Int, then takes another Int, produces an Int"
-- Really means: Int -> (Int -> Int)
```

### Guard vs If-Then-Else

```haskell
-- Avoid deeply nested if-then-else:
if score >= 90 then "A" else if score >= 80 then "B" else ...

-- Use guards instead:
gradeToLetter score
  | score >= 90 = "A"
  | score >= 80 = "B"
  -- much cleaner!
```
