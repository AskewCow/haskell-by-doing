ðŸ“‹ === HOW TO TEST YOUR SOLUTIONS ===

1. Complete the exercises below (replace 'undefined' with your code)
2. Open terminal in this folder (01-Fundamentals)
3. Run the automated tester: runghc tester.hs
4. See instant results with [PASS] for pass, [FAIL] for fail
5. Fix any issues and test again!

The tester will:
   âœ“ Check if your code compiles
   âœ“ Test Exercise 1: "Hello, Haskell!" output
   âœ“ Test Exercise 2: Name greeting with simulated input
   âœ“ Give you a summary of passed/failed tests

ðŸŽ‰ No manual verification needed - everything is automated!

-- ðŸ‘‹ Exercise 2: Ask for your name and greet the user
-- TODO: Write a program that:
-- 1. Asks "What is your name?"
-- 2. Reads the user's input
-- 3. Greets them with "Hello, [name]!"
